Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage and infrastructure), over the internet.

Main types of cloud computing:

1.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) : IaaS allows access to networking features, computers, and data storage space. IaaS is the most customizable type of cloud computing. It allows the highest level of management control over your IT resources.

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) : Platform as a Service gives organizations the ability to prioritize the deployment and management of their applications by taking away the need to manage fundamental infrastructure such as capacity planning and software maintenance.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS is run and managed solely by the cloud service provider. SaaS mostly refers to end-user applications; with this cloud computing type organizations only have to decide how they are going to use the software.   

Benefits of cloud computing:

●Accessibility: You can access your resources anywhere, at any time as long as you have access to the internet.

●Innovation: You have access to the latest technologies and services without having to manage them yourself.
